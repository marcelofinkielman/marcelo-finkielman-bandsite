      <h2>Xavier de Rosnay & Gaspard Augé</h2>
      <p>Xavier De Ronsay and Gaspard Augé had a few
        mutual friends, who happened to run a record label,
        seeking tracks for a compilation. With an immediate
        connection, the pair decided to try their hand at
        making a song. That’s when they created their
        breakout single, We Are Your Friends – a feel-good,
        funk-filled, instant anthem that lost the remix
        contest, but won the attention of Pedro Winter,
        director of the newly founded Ed Banger Records,
        who boasted Daft Punk as former clients. One week
        later, they were in his office, signing a record deal.</p>
