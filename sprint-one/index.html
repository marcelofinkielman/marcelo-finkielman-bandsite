      <p>Xavier De Ronsay and Gaspard Augé had a few
      mutual friends, who happened to run a record label,
      seeking tracks for a compilation. With an immediate
      connection, the pair decided to try their hand at
      making a song. That’s when they created their
      breakout single, We Are Your Friends – a feel-good,
      funk-filled, instant anthem that lost the remix
      contest, but won the attention of Pedro Winter,
      director of the newly founded Ed Banger Records,
      who boasted Daft Punk as former clients. One week
      later, they were in his office, signing a record deal.</p>
